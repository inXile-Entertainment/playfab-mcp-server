# PlayFab MCP Server

## What Is This? 🤔

This server is a middleware that enables large language models (like Claude and VS Code) to interact directly with PlayFab services. Acting as a secure and efficient translator, it connects your AI assistant with various PlayFab functionalities, such as item search, segment inquiries, player profile lookups, inventory management, and PlayFab ID conversion.

### Quick Example

```text
You: "Show me the latest 10 items."
Claude: *calls the PlayFab search_items API and returns the results in plain text*
```

## How Does It Work? 🛠️

This server leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to establish a universal interface between AI models and PlayFab services. Although MCP is designed to support any AI model, it is currently available as a developer preview.

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Set up your project.
2. Add your project details to your LLM client's configuration.
3. Start interacting with PlayFab data naturally!

### What Can It Do? 📊

#### Catalog & Search

- Search for items using PlayFab's search_items API.
- **Catalog Management (Economy v2):**
  - Create new draft items with the create_draft_item API.
  - Update existing draft items with the update_draft_item API.
  - Delete items from catalog with the delete_item API.
  - Publish draft items to make them available with the publish_draft_item API.
  - Get detailed item information with the get_item API.

#### Player Management

- Retrieve comprehensive segment information.
- Query player profiles within specified segments.
- Convert a PlayFab ID to a Title Player Account ID via the get_title_player_account_id_from_playfab_id API.
- Get detailed user account information with the get_user_account_info API.

#### Inventory Management

- **Get Operations:**
  - Retrieve current inventory items with the get_inventory_items API.
  - Fetch inventory collection IDs using the get_inventory_collection_ids API.
- **Add/Remove Operations:**
  - Add items to inventory with the add_inventory_items API.
  - Delete items from inventory with the delete_inventory_items API.
  - Subtract specific amounts with the subtract_inventory_items API.
- **Modify Operations:**
  - Update item properties with the update_inventory_items API.

#### Economy v2 Administration

- Execute batch inventory operations with the execute_inventory_operations API.
- Note: In Economy v2, virtual currencies are managed as inventory items.

#### User Account Administration

- Ban players by ID, IP, or MAC address with the ban_users API.
- Unban players completely with the revoke_all_bans_for_user API.

#### Player Data Management

- Retrieve player custom data with the get_user_data API.
- Update player custom data with the update_user_data API.

#### Title Configuration Management

- Set global title data with the set_title_data API.
- Retrieve title data with the get_title_data API.
- Set server-only internal data with the set_title_internal_data API.
- Retrieve internal data with the get_title_internal_data API.

#### News Management

- Create localized news items with the add_localized_news API.
- Retrieve current news with the get_title_news API.

#### Analytics (KQL / Data Explorer)

- Run KQL queries against PlayFab Insights / Azure Data Explorer with the query_analytics API.
- Query player events, telemetry, PlayStream events, and custom events sent from game clients.
- Supports full KQL syntax including `where`, `summarize`, `project`, `join`, `render`, etc.
- Requires Azure AD credentials (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below).

## Quick Start 🚀

### One-Line Setup (Windows)

Run this in PowerShell to interactively configure the MCP server for your AI client(s) — no need to clone the repo:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inXile-Entertainment/playfab-mcp-server/main/setup-playfab-mcp.ps1 | iex
```

The script will:

1. Check that Node.js 18+ is installed
2. Prompt for your PlayFab credentials (and optionally Azure AD for analytics)
3. Let you pick which AI clients to configure (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, VS Code, Cursor)
4. Write the correct config files, merging with any existing MCP servers

If you prefer manual setup, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher.
- A valid PlayFab account (obtain your Title ID and Developer Secret Key via PlayFab Game Manager).
- A supported LLM client such as Claude Desktop, Claude Code (CLI), Cursor, or VS Code.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PLAYFAB_TITLE_ID` | Yes | Your PlayFab Title ID (5 hex characters, e.g. `F85D2`). Found in PlayFab Game Manager. |
| `PLAYFAB_DEV_SECRET_KEY` | Yes | Developer Secret Key from PlayFab Game Manager > Settings > Secret Keys. |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | For analytics | Azure AD Tenant ID. Required for KQL/Insights queries. |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | For analytics | Azure AD Application (client) ID. Required for KQL/Insights queries. |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` | For analytics | Azure AD Client Secret. Required for KQL/Insights queries. |
| `AZURE_ADX_CLUSTER_URL` | Optional | Custom ADX cluster URL. Defaults to `https://insights.playfab.com`. |
| `AZURE_ADX_DATABASE` | Optional | Custom ADX database name. Defaults to your Title ID. |

The first two variables are needed for all PlayFab operations. The Azure AD variables are only needed if you want to run KQL analytics queries against PlayFab Insights.

> **Where to get Azure AD credentials:** Create an App Registration in Azure Portal, grant it access to your PlayFab Insights cluster, then use the Tenant ID, Application ID, and a Client Secret. See [Connecting to Insights with Kusto](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/data-analytics/legacy/connectivity/connecting-kusto-csharp-to-insights) for details.

### Set Up Your Project

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your credentials:

```bash
# Required

### Spec-Driven Development (Spec Kit, JP)

- Install CLI: `uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/akiojin/spec-kit.git`
- Create spec/plan/tasks: `./.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh "feature summary"`（デフォルトはブランチを作成しない。必要なら `--branch`）
- Assets: `.specify/templates/*`, `.specify/scripts/bash/*`, specs under `specs/`
- Claude/Codex slash commands: `/speckit.constitution`, `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, `/speckit.implement`

### Docker Development Environment

The repository ships with a lightweight dev container (Node 22, tooling, GitHub CLI).

```bash
# Build image
docker compose build

# Open a shell inside the container
docker compose run --rm playfab-mcp-server bash

# Inside the container
npm ci
npm run build
npm start
```

Volumes keep your workspace (`.`), Codex/Claude configs, and shell history. Set `PLAYFAB_TITLE_ID` / `PLAYFAB_DEV_SECRET_KEY` in the container env when running the server.

### Running with Cursor

To use the PlayFab MCP server with Cursor, follow these steps:

1. Install [Cursor Desktop](https://cursor.so/) if you haven't already.
2. Open a new instance of Cursor in an empty folder.
3. Copy the [`mcp.json`](./.cursor/mcp.json) file from this repository into your folder and update the values according to your environment.
4. Launch Cursor; the PlayFab MCP Server should appear in the tools list.
5. For example, try a prompt like "Show me the latest 10 items" to verify that the server processes your query correctly.

### Running with Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop and navigate to **File > Settings > Developer > Edit Config**. Then add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playfab": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@akiojin/playfab-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PLAYFAB_TITLE_ID": "Your PlayFab Title ID",
        "PLAYFAB_DEV_SECRET_KEY": "Your PlayFab Developer Secret Key",
        "AZURE_TENANT_ID": "Your Azure Tenant ID (optional, for analytics)",
        "AZURE_CLIENT_ID": "Your Azure Client ID (optional, for analytics)",
        "AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET": "Your Azure Client Secret (optional, for analytics)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Remove the `AZURE_*` lines if you don't need analytics/KQL query support.

### Running with Claude Code (CLI)

Add the server to your project's `.mcp.json` or your global Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playfab": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@akiojin/playfab-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "PLAYFAB_TITLE_ID": "Your PlayFab Title ID",
        "PLAYFAB_DEV_SECRET_KEY": "Your PlayFab Developer Secret Key",
        "AZURE_TENANT_ID": "Your Azure Tenant ID (optional)",
        "AZURE_CLIENT_ID": "Your Azure Client ID (optional)",
        "AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET": "Your Azure Client Secret (optional)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Running with VS Code

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "PlayFab": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@akiojin/playfab-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "PLAYFAB_TITLE_ID": "Your PlayFab Title ID",
        "PLAYFAB_DEV_SECRET_KEY": "Your PlayFab Developer Secret Key",
        "AZURE_TENANT_ID": "Your Azure Tenant ID (optional)",
        "AZURE_CLIENT_ID": "Your Azure Client ID (optional)",
        "AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET": "Your Azure Client Secret (optional)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Verify It Works

Once configured, try these prompts in your AI client to confirm everything is connected:

| Prompt | Tests |
|--------|-------|
| `"Show me the latest 10 items"` | Basic PlayFab connectivity (catalog search) |
| `"Get all player segments"` | Player/segment API access |
| `['ingested-data'] \| take 10` | Analytics/KQL connectivity (requires Azure AD setup) |

If you get results back, you're good to go.

## Spec-Driven Development with Spec Kit

This repository follows the Spec Kit SDD/TDD workflow used in `akiojin/gwt`.

- Requirements: Python 3.11+ and `uv`
- Install CLI: `uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/akiojin/spec-kit.git`
- Assets: templates under `.specify/templates`, scripts under `.specify/scripts/bash`, specs live in `specs/`
- Create a new spec/plan: `./.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh "feature summary"` (add `--branch` if you also want a branch)
- Generated files include `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`; keep them reviewed/committed alongside code
- Claude/Codex slash commands (if available): `/speckit.constitution`, `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, `/speckit.implement`

## Contributing

### Commit Message Convention

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated versioning and release.

#### Commit Message Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Types

- **feat**: A new feature (triggers MINOR version bump)
- **fix**: A bug fix (triggers PATCH version bump)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

#### Version Bumping Rules

- **MAJOR** version: When commit message contains `BREAKING CHANGE` in footer or `!` after type/scope
  - Example: `feat!: remove deprecated API endpoints`
  - Example: `feat: new API\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: removed old endpoints`
- **MINOR** version: When commit type is `feat`
  - Example: `feat: add new PlayFab API integration`
- **PATCH** version: When commit type is `fix`
  - Example: `fix: correct error handling in API calls`

### Release Process (develop → main, release-please)

1. **Prepare release PR**: Run the `prepare-release.yml` workflow to open a PR from `develop` to `main`  
   - Actions UI: `Prepare Release` → run with ref `develop`  
   - CLI: `gh workflow run prepare-release.yml --ref develop`  
   - If a PR from `develop` already exists, it will be reused; PRs opened from `develop` can be auto-merged by the workflow.
2. **Release automation**: When `main` is updated, `release.yml` runs release-please (manifest) to bump versions, update `CHANGELOG.md`, and create the GitHub Release/tag.
3. **Publish**: Tag push `v*` triggers `publish.yml` to run tests, build, typecheck, and `npm publish --access public`.

Required secrets:
- `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (optional; used by `prepare-release`/`release` when provided, falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- `NPM_TOKEN` (for `publish.yml`)

Branch protection: keep protections on `main`; release PRs should satisfy required checks before merge.
